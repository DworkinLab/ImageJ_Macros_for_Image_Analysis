# ImageJ Macros for Image Analysis
These are simple Image J macros written to get count or size/ area estimates for
- whole fly bodies
- immuno-staining images
- fly wings

Either as the only ROI (for instance a single fly wing) or isolated from multiple ROIs (for instance from a 96-well plate; adapted from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/readplate/index.html)

# Disclaimer
- These were written in ImageJ version 1.48 and have not been tested in the current version of ImageJ (v1.52). As with any bit of code, there is a good chance that these scripts may require tweaking to work with the most recent version.
